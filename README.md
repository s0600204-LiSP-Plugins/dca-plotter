The **DCA Plotter** is a community-created plugin for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

This plugin adds the ability to program in VCA/DCA changes that are then
transmitted to suuported Sound Desks via MIDI.


### Installation


To use, navigate to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/LinuxShowPlayer/$LiSP_Version/plugins/` (on
most Linux systems `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is `~/.local/share`), and create a subfolder
named `dca_plotter`.

Place the files comprising this plugin into this new folder.

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load the plugin
automatically.
