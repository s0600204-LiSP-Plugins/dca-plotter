The **DCA Plotter** is a community-created plugin for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

This plugin adds the ability to program in VCA/DCA changes that are then
transmitted to suuported Sound Desks via MIDI.


### Installation

To use, place the contents in a subfolder of `$XDG_DATA_HOME/linux_show_player/plugins`
(On most Linux systems, this will default to `~/.share/linux_show_player/plugins`.)

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load the plugin
automatically.
